This is a project within the Web Development 101 Chapter "Project: Google Homepage" by the The Odin Project.

As assignment, students need to demonstrate their HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge by deconstructing and rebuilding a simple website (without working functions at this point of the course). For this example the Google homepage will be used.

My project is the starting point for many more projects and will therefore focus mostly on demonstrating simple skills like:

- moving the position of a div
- using an absolute position (at bottom of page) for the div
- setting a background color
- using an existing link for an image to incorporate it on the page
- building and positioning a form in the center of the page
- using CSS style method
- using an ID to style elements
